# text-to-12yo-reddit-bot
replies to reddit comments with text converted into 12-y/o-speak

The bot currently runs on [/u/tyo-translate](http:/www.reddit.com/u/tyo-translate) and can be invoked in two ways:

(1) By mentioning /u/tyo-translate anywhere in the comment. The bot will then reply to your comment with a translation of the the text within your comment.
(2) By mentioning only /u/tyo-translate in your comment, without any additional text. The bot will then reply to your comment with a translation of the parent comment (i.e. the comment you replied to).

The bot should reply within around 10-15 seconds to your comment.
